## API (Incomplete)

### IronSource.initializeIronSource(ironSourceAppKey, userId, options)
Initializes IronSource SDK. 

 `validateIntegration` provides an easy way to verify 
that you’ve successfully integrated the ironSource 
SDK and any additional adapters; it also makes sure all
 required dependencies and frameworks were added for 
 the various mediated ad networks. It doesn't validate Amazon adapter in current version.
 See official docs for [Android](https://developers.ironsrc.com/ironsource-mobile/android/integration-helper-android/), 
 [iOS](https://developers.ironsrc.com/ironsource-mobile/ios/integration-helper-ios/).
  There's known issue in ios 12. See known issue section.
#### Parameter(s)
* **ironSourceAppKey:** String. Can be found in Iron Source administrator's interface
* **userId:** String. Any unique user id.
* **options:** Object (optional)
    * **validateIntegration:** Boolean. Default: false
#### Returns Promise

```javascript
IronSource.initializeIronSource('8a19a09d', 'userId', {
  validateIntegration: true
})
  .then(() => {
    console.warn('Init finished');
  });
```

### IronSourceBanner.loadBanner(options)
Loads IronSource banner. Returns a promise that will be resolved when banner loads successfully and rejected when it fails.

#### Parameter(s)
* **options:** Object (optional)
    * **position:** String. Supported values: "top" or "bottom". Default: "bottom".
    * **scaleToFitWidth:** Boolean. Default: false
#### Returns Promise of
* **response:** Object
    * **width:** Number
    * **height:** Number

```javascript
IronSourceBanner.loadBanner({
  position: 'top',
  scaleToFitWidth: true
})
  .then((response) => {
    console.warn(`width: ${response.width}, height: ${response.height}`);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.warn(err.message);
  });
```

## Mediation Setup

**WARNING!** Make sure you following the doc carefully. If you miss something in the mediation setup process for some network it may not work partially or entirely.

Official doc:
- [Android](https://developers.ironsrc.com/ironsource-mobile/android/mediation-networks-android/#step-1).
- [iOS](https://developers.ironsrc.com/ironsource-mobile/ios/mediation-networks-ios/#step-1).

You can optionally use this syntax to add iOS mediation adapters instead of suggested by the doc.
```
pod 'RNIronSource', :path => '../node_modules/@wowmaking/react-native-iron-source', :subspecs => [
    'Core', # required
    'AdColony',
    'Admob',
    'Amazon',
    'AppLovin',
    'Chartboost',
    'Facebook',
    'HyprMX',
    'InMobi',
    'Maio',
    'MediaBrix',
    'Tapjoy',
    'UnityAds',
    'Vungle'
]
```

## Known issues

Ads may stop loading properly when "Reload" option (or CMD+R) in your React Native app was used. You have to restart the app completely if you want to check that ads load and display correctly.

---
Native sdk has a known issue with the integration validator- on iOS 12 it prints out that some frameworks are missing when they aren’t. It will be fix in next versions.
You can safely ignore the following logs when you see them on iOS 12:


>Missing system framework: CoreGraphics, please be sure to add it to your project. 
Missing system framework: UIKit, please be sure to add it to your project.
Missing system framework: MobileCoreServices, please be sure to add it to your project.
